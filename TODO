- [ ] Web UI for easy searching and access
- [ ] is this is a foreign language? 'https://www.coopercapital.org/'
- [ ] handle pages which 404 and try non-www version on the root url when expanding the url
- [ ] dedup content, currently this is really naive
- [ ] switch model based on context size to avoid using 16k for everything
  - [ ] openai.ts started doing this, but need to finish
- [ ] extract typing helpers into a separate file
- [ ] don't crawl PDFs
- [ ] should probably use a legit ORM (TypedORM?)

## scraping issues

- [ ] https://preludeventures.com has a `www.` version too which all the urls point to
- [ ] https://www.felicis.com/team/tim-bertrand only finds the root url, not the subpages
- [ ] https://playfair.vc/about.php is not categorized properly, probably need markdown content in categorization

## company information

What data should we get about companies via GPT?

- location
- type: private equity, venture capital
-

## outcome

- [ ] publish dataset to dolthub
- [ ] can we convert the data to sqlite very easily?
- [ ] publish code to an open source repo
